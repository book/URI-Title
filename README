NAME
   URI::Title - get the titles of things on the web in a sensible way

DESCRIPTION

   I keep having to find the title of things on the web. This seems like a
   really simple request, just get() the object, parse for a title tag,
   you're done. Ha, I wish. There are several problems with this approach:

   What if the resource is on a very slow server? Do we wait for ever or what?
   What if the resource is a 900 gig file? You don't want to download that.
   What if the page title isn't in a title tag, but is buried in the HTML somewhere?
   What if the resource is an MP3 file, or a word document or something?
   ...

   So, let's solve these issues once.

METHODS
   only one, the title(url) method. Call it with an url, get the title if
   possible, undef if it wasn't. Very simple.
